Alright, so here's the scoop: we're trying to predict who's gonna get two flu vaccines—the xyz one and the seasonal one. It's like playing fortune teller but for vaccines. This problem's called multilabel classification, 'cause some folks might get both shots, just one, or none.

First off, we gotta grab our data from CSV files. It's like getting the secret sauce for our predictions.

Next up, we gotta tidy up the data. We split it into two types: numbers (like ages or temperatures) and categories (like names or types of flu). For the numbers, if we're missing any, we fill 'em in with the middle value (the median) and make sure they're all on the same scale. For the categories, we fill in any blanks with the most common stuff and turn 'em into numbers so the computer can understand.

Now, we take a chunk of the training data—about 10%—to work with. Gotta do this so our computer doesn't throw a fit. Then, we split this chunk into two parts: one to teach our model (training) and one to test how well it learned (validation).

Time to pick a model! We're going with MultiOutputClassifier using LogisticRegression as the base. It's good for this 'cause it can handle lots of labels at once. We teach it with the training data so it can figure out who's likely to get which vaccine.

After training, we gotta check our model's report card using the validation set. We calculate the ROC AUC score for each vaccine type. This score tells us how close our guesses are to reality—higher is better.

Finally, it's crunch time: we gotta predict who's getting what in the test set. But we gotta be careful—chunk by chunk—to keep our computer happy. Once we've made our predictions, we put 'em all together and save 'em in a neat little CSV file.

And that's the plan! Easy peasy, right?
